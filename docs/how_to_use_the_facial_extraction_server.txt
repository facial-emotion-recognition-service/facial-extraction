IMAGE_INPUT_DIR/multi_faces.jpg

4.2 Run python3 main_server.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

5) Use the server API
5.1 Test the server with CURL in terminal: curl http://localhost:8000/hello
5.2 Test the faces api with CURL in terminal: curl http://localhost:8000/faces/multi_faces.jpg

You can also test both API with your browser
